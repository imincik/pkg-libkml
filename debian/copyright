Comment: Decryption code comes from crypt.c by Info-ZIP but has been greatly
 reduced in terms of compatibility with older software. The following is from
 the original crypt.c. Code woven in by Terry Thorsen 1/2003.
 .
 Copyright (c) 1990-2000 Info-ZIP.  All rights reserved.
 .
 See the accompanying file LICENSE, version 2000-Apr-09 or later
 (the contents of which are also included in zip.h) for terms of use.
 If, for some reason, all these files are missing, the Info-ZIP license
 also may be found at:  ftp://ftp.info-zip.org/pub/infozip/license.html
 .
 crypt.c (full version) by Info-ZIP.      Last revised:  [see crypt.h]
 .
 The encryption/decryption parts of this source code (as opposed to the
 non-echoing password parts) were originally written in Europe.  The
 whole source package can be freely distributed, including from the USA.
 (Prior to January 2000, re-export from the US was a violation of US law.)
 .
 This encryption code is a direct transcription of the algorithm from
 Roger Schlafly, described by Phil Katz in the file appnote.txt.  This
 file (appnote.txt) is distributed with the PKZIP program (even in the
 version without encryption capabilities).

Comment: This file is from the proposed iomem_simple package found at
 http://code.trak.dk/
 .
 ioapi_mem2.c -- IO base function header for compress/uncompress .zip
 files using zlib + zip or unzip API
 .
 This version of ioapi is designed to access memory rather than files.
 We do use a region of memory to put data in to and take it out of. We do
 not have auto-extending buffers and do not inform anyone else that the
 data has been written. It is really intended for accessing a zip archive
 embedded in an application such that I can write an installer with no
 external files. Creation of archives has not been attempted, although
 parts of the framework are present.
 .
 Based on Unzip ioapi.c version 0.22, May 19th, 2003
 .

 Dynamically allocated memory version. Troels K 2004
    mem_close deletes the data: file is single-session. No filenames.

Comment: This code is a modified version of crypting code in Infozip distribution
 .
 The encryption/decryption parts of this source code (as opposed to the
 non-echoing password parts) were originally written in Europe.  The
 whole source package can be freely distributed, including from the USA.
 (Prior to January 2000, re-export from the US was a violation of US law.)
 .
 This encryption code is a direct transcription of the algorithm from
 Roger Schlafly, described by Phil Katz in the file appnote.txt.  This
 file (appnote.txt) is distributed with the PKZIP program (even in the
 version without encryption capabilities).
 .
 If you don't need crypting in your application, just define symbols
 NOCRYPT and NOUNCRYPT.
 .
 This code support the "Traditional PKWARE Encryption".
 .
 The new AES encryption added on Zip format by Winzip (see the page
 http://www.winzip.com/aes_info.htm ) and PKWare PKZip 5.x Strong
 Encryption is not supported.
